🌱 Vision: Personalized Learning That Grows With Every Child

Every child learns differently — even if they’re in the same grade.
BrainyBunny was created with one simple belief:

Homework should adapt to the child, not the other way around.

Our mission is to transform homework into a personalized growth journey — one that evolves with the learner.
BrainyBunny observes how each child learns, analyzes patterns from their responses, and intelligently generates tailor-made worksheets that balance challenge with encouragement.

For parents, it’s more than a tool — it’s a window into their child’s learning mind.
It offers coaching tips, progress insights, and emotional cues to help them nurture confidence and curiosity.
For kids, it keeps learning fun, achievable, and full of discovery. 🐰

In essence: BrainyBunny isn’t just an AI homework generator — it’s a gentle, growing companion for every learner and family.

BrainyBunny is a modern web application designed to help parents and educators create personalized, engaging homework for children. It leverages the Google Gemini API to generate a wide variety of educational content and provides an interactive platform for students to practice and learn.

The entire application runs in a **full-featured guest mode**, allowing immediate access without needing an account. All session data, including multiple student profiles, is conveniently saved in your browser.
